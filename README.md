# Zendesk Coding Challenge - API Ticket Viewer

## Production Plan

* 1. Access the Zendesk Tickets API (completed 10:30pm 11/05/21)

* 2. Create an interactive user menu, with options to show all tickets (25 at a time) and select a single ticket (completed 10:30pm 13/05/21)

* 3. Make the menu options behave correctly (pagination and specific ticket selection included) (completed 4:00pm 14/05/21)

* 4. Make the ticket viewer able to handle the API being unavailable and will display a friendly error message (complete 8:45pm 16/05/21)

* 6. Refactor code to separate concerns (optional)
